## My life with Android since 2010

I produce Apps as products with a hope that people would really use it, not just coding.

- ⌨️ I learnt Android App programming by myself (through reverse engineering), and published my first App in 2010
- 📱 I have published 13 Apps on Google Play under _RW Android Labs_ / _RW MobiMedia_ since 2010
- 💰 I personally own Android Apps that are profitable, and hit 1,000,000+ downloads
- 🗂 I have 8+ years full time and contractor commercial Android-Java development (and some leadership) experience, covering the whole product cycle:<br/>you just tell me your idea and pay me, then I'll design, develop, launch, and maange the Apps for you.

## Languages and Tools

Currently I spend all of my time on Kotlin. I enjoy using it as my main language. I do know some other languages but it will take me some time if I have to pick them up again.

- 🖥 My programming language history: LOGO, GWBASIC, Pascal, JavaScript, Perl, Java, PHP, Python, Kotlin 
- 💼 I used to do multimedia/video-on-demand, web design/programming, and system administrations with some vendor certifications

👇 The contribution graph below has most of my activities between late 2016-early 2021 removed. 
This is because I have withdrawn access to my clients' repositories after their projects with RW MobiMedia UK Limited have concluded.
I have used Subversion from 2008 to 2016.
