## TLDR

## My life with Android since 2010

I produce Apps as products, hoping people would use them, not just code.

- ⌨️ I was a self-taught Android Developer (through reverse engineering).
- 📱 I have published 13 Apps on Google Play under _RW Android Labs_ / _RW MobiMedia_ since 2010.
- 💰 I privately own profitable Android Apps that hit 1,000,000+ downloads.
- 🗂 I have 9+ years of full-time and contractor commercial Android Apps development (and some leadership) experience,
  covering the whole product cycle.

## Languages and Tools

- Most key public Github repositories are backed by Github Actions and Renovate for automation.<br/>
- Kotlin is my current main language. I spend all of my time on it and enjoy using it. <br/>
- Java was my primary language from 1999 to 2021. I have several Java certifications. <br/>
- I learned other languages and wrote pretty good Pascal code 30 years ago. Now I cannot write any without warming up
  again. So, be practical :)<br/>

## Publications

Initially, my blog was a personal repository, aiding my not-so-perfect memory. But it morphed into something greater
during my stint in the UK. I appreciate if you follow and clap on my articles
on [my medium.com blog site](https://medium.com/@callmeryan/).
