## TLDR

- 🌱 Learning `Jetpack Compose`, `Coroutines`, `Kotlin Multiplatform` and `Compose Multiplatform`.
- 📝 Publishing sample Apps and experimental projects here for reference and collaboration.

## My life with Android since 2010

I produce Apps as products, hoping people would use them, not just code.

- ⌨️ I was a self-taught Android Developer (through reverse engineering). I published my first App in 2010.
- 📱 I have published 13 Apps on Google Play under _RW Android Labs_ / _RW MobiMedia_ since 2010.
- 💰 I own Android Apps that are profitable and hit 1,000,000+ downloads.
- 🗂 I have 8+ years of full-time and contractor commercial Android Apps development (and some leadership) experience, covering the whole product cycle.
- 👨🏻‍🦲 In case you cannot spot it, my code style and habit changed a bit after working with someone closely for months in 2022.

## Languages and Tools

Currently I spend all of my time on Kotlin. I enjoy using it as my main language. <br/>
Java was my primary language from 1999 to 2021, and I know some other languages, but it will take me some time to pick them up again. <br/>
I wrote pretty good Pascal code 30 years ago, but I guess now I cannot write any without warming up again. So, be practical :)<br/>

- 🖥 My programming language history: LOGO, GWBASIC, Pascal, JavaScript, Perl, Java, PHP, Python, Kotlin 
- 💼 I used to do multimedia/video-on-demand, web design/programming, and system administrations with some vendor certifications

👇 The contribution graph below has removed most of my activities between late 2016-early 2021. <br/>
I have withdrawn access to my clients' repositories after their projects with RW MobiMedia UK Limited have concluded.<br/>
I used Subversion from 2008 to 2016. <br/>
I used Java for Android before working in the UK in 2021. At that time, British employers told me, 'No Kotlin, no job'.
