## TLDR

- 📝 Publishing sample Apps and experimental projects here for reference and collaboration.

## My life with Android since 2010

I produce Apps as products, hoping people would use them, not just code.

- ⌨️ I was a self-taught Android Developer (through reverse engineering).
- 📱 I have published 13 Apps on Google Play under _RW Android Labs_ / _RW MobiMedia_ since 2010.
- 💰 I privately own profitable Android Apps that hit 1,000,000+ downloads.
- 🗂 I have 9+ years of full-time and contractor commercial Android Apps development (and some leadership) experience, covering the whole product cycle.

## Languages and Tools

Currently, Kotlin is my main language. I spend all of my time on it and enjoy using it. <br/>
Java was my primary language from 1999 to 2021. I have several Java certifications. <br/>
I learned other languages and wrote pretty good Pascal code 30 years ago. Now I cannot write any without warming up again. So, be practical :)<br/>

- 🖥 Languages history: LOGO, GWBASIC, Visual Basic, Pascal, JavaScript, Perl, (ActionScript/Lingo), Java, (some VC++, eVC++), PHP, ASP.Net, Python, Kotlin 
- 💼 I used to do multimedia/video-on-demand, web design/programming, and system administrations (with a list of vendor certifications)
